        <td id ="userQ"><b>Engagement:</b> How engaging is the app? Is it visually appealing? Does it have sound and animation to 
            capture the user's attention? Does it have a good balance of challenge and reward?</td>

        <td id="GREEN"> Kahoot has a music track playing while you wait for a Kahoot to start, the song is rather catchy
            the site also has many abstract shapes in the background which certainly catches the user’s attention, 
            the site has a good sense of reward by awarding them, at the end of rounds there is also a rewards ceremony, 
            anyone who falls outside the top 5 get an encouraging message to cheer them on. 
            he site overall has an appealing design too, with bright eye-catching colors 
            10/10  </td>
        <td id="YELLOW"> Coursera has a lot of logos on its front page, this will immediately draw the user in, 
            most of the site is static images with very little to no animation. 
            The site itself is also rather bland with most of it being on a white background
             which while looks fine, doesn’t engage the user, there is also no sound to be found. 
             5/10 </td>
        <td id="GREEN"> Typing.com uses appealing colors like Blue to engage the viewer as soon as they visit the site, 
            the homepage features blanked out letters being filled via animation to capture the users attention, the site 
            has many games in between typing lessons to keep the user’s attention, there is also a sound when you hit the keys on the site, 
            along with this the games and tasks steadily increase in challenge, making the user feel proud when they accomplish a difficult task

            <td id = "userQ">Progress tracking: How well does the app track the user's progress? Does it provide feedback and 
                recommendations to help users improve their performance? Does it use data to personalize the
                learning experience?</td>
            <td id="GREEN">Kahoot.com keeps track of all the quizzes you completed, and suggests more the site thinks you would 
                enjoy, it also allows you to create your own quizzes to suit your own needs. 
                10/10 </td>
            <td id="GREEN"> Coursera keeps track of all the courses you have completed, it suggests courses the site thinks you 
                would enjoy based on your past course choices, this helps users to decide on what course they should do next. 
                It also provides feedback on how you did after a course. 
                10/10 </td>
                <td id="GREEN"> Typing.com keeps track of tasks you’ve completed, has a mini level up system, 
                    calculates many statistics, i.e. average speed, typing time and accuracy all of which is good feedback, 
                    however it does not personalize the site with this data, it does recommend you to keep completing challenges 
                    and to reach the daily typing time of 15 minutes each day, but these are not personalized, 
                    however it does what percentage of the exercises you have completed 
                    8/10 </td>

                <td id = "userQ">User experience: How user-friendly is the app? Is it easy to navigate and use? Does it have 
                    clear instructions and prompts? Does it have a well-designed interface?</td>
                <td id="GREEN"> Kahoot has a very well designed interface, 
                    the side tab has clearly labelled links which make sense, many of the tabs on the homepage have info prompts 
                    above explaining what they do, the interface is well designed but slightly cluttered, 
                    a lot of information is placed on the screen at once which can very easily overwhelm the user and can make it 
                    slightly difficult to navigate. The site also has instructions before each Kahoot explaining how to play the 
                    game by clicking the answer 
                    9/10 </td>
                <td id="YELLOW"> Coursera has a somewhat confusing layout, the front page is mainly plastered with pay images, 
                    the search bar is next to another tab called explore, which at first, 
                    I thought would do the same, but both do something different, 
                    it’s also not immediately clear where you should go next, as there is tabs saying “find your degree” 
                    “online degrees” and also randomly suggested degrees, it lacks instructions which is off putting, 
                    when looking for a course the interface is rather small for the courses and can be hard to see 
                    5/10  </td>
                <td id="GREEN"> Typing.com has a very friendly interface with very clear instructions, 
                    making it easy to navigate, on the side bar displaying tabs, like easy, 
                    intermediate and difficult under the challenges tab making it clear what does what.
                    The interface is very well designed,
